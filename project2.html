    <h1>Sculpture Pavillion in the Holland Park</h1>
     <h2>/2020/</h2>
    <p> In SIAT's Spatial Design course, which is a challenging class that incorporates high expectations on applying critical thinking to understand and design spaces used by people, my team had to design a Sculpture Pavilion in Holland Park for visitors to appreciate the artwork and rest. </p>

   <h2>Identify the need</h2>
      <p>Design a human-centered sculpture pavilion in Holland Park for visitors to appreciate art pieces and rest.</p>

      <h2>Design Focus</h2>
      <p>Choose an appealing location at Holland Park and create a place of significance from that location. Make the pavilion fully utilized and integrated into the natural atmosphere of that location.</p>

      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>All aged Holland Park visitors who are trying to appreciate art pieces and take a rest.</p>

<h2>Design Process and Challenges</h2>
    
    <p> As a member of a team of four, I was in charge of the planning, graphic design, and leadership within my group. Choosing a well-designed space to build our Pavilion was a challenge we need to overcome. The first step I took was leading other team members to Holland Park to find some inspiration and considered the best construction location from the user's point of view. Then a particular spot surrounded by trees and plants in the park drew my attention. I googled a satellite view of Holland Park and began sketching out where the Pavilion was by using Photoshop. Afterward, I searched for inspiration for the style of the Pavilion online. I collected a lot of images that evoked the clean and peaceful feelings I wanted my visitors to experience and then created a mood board to help my teammates understand my inspiration for designing the Pavilion. I continued drawing more sketches on Procreate to reiterate the style of the Pavilion. The trees and plants created a healing and peaceful atmosphere for visitors. In this sense, I decided to create an open circular terrace to let the visitors appreciate art in an environment surrounded by nature and then easily get immersed in nature and the art displays. I made multiple adjustments until I was satisfied, then my teammates implemented my design and made our final digital version of the project using KeyShot.  
</p>

<h2>Final Result</h2>
<p>Finally, our hard work resulted in an A+ for the final project and an overall grade of A for the course.</p>


<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>Based on field trips and user research, keep changing ideas and iterate. Put the users first, and always thinking from their side. If I have the chance, I want to create a real physical model of our pavilion instead of a digital model to see if our idea truly works.</p>
