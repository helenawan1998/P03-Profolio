    <h1>LOVE & CONFETTI</h1>
     <h2>/2020/</h2>
    <p> In SIAT's Web Design and Development course, which incorporates high expectations on creating a fully functional responsive company website, my team had to design a customized company website accessible for all users. We created a brand new wedding company website named Love & Confetti from scratch.</p>

       <div class="work2background"> </div>


    <div class="work1intro2">

      <h2>Identify the need (what does the company do?)</h2>
      <p>A team of professional photographers, professional make-up artists based in Vancouver BC Canada who specialize in wedding, pre-wedding and engagement photography. Our goal is to make your special day as beautiful and memorable as it can be.</p>

      <h2>Design Focus</h2>
      <p>Create a fully functional/responsive wedding company website that is accessible for all users. Focus on offering great variety of service, includes wedding plan, wedding makeup, and wedding photography.</p>

      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>All aged couples who are trying to plan a perfect wedding, or who just wants to take couple photos. Our price make sure most people find it affordable.</p>

<h2>Design Process</h2>
    
    <p> As a member of a team of three, I was in charge of planning, visual/graphic design, coding, and debugging with my group. In order to deliver a cohesive brand and perfect user experience, I collected wedding images that evoked a lovely and peaceful feeling that I want the website users to experience and then created a mood board to help my teammates understand my inspiration for designing the company website visual art/graphic. The overall warm color tone makes the cold website a sweet and impressive one. After that, I lead my teammates to define and evolve style guides, drawing draft wireframes for homepage and product list page to clearly communicate design intentions. I am mainly responsible for writing the code of the contact us webpage and part of the homepage/product list webpages. 
</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>It is our first time to create a responsive website. I lead the team to learn and improve the responsive features of all the web pages on our website. In order to design a human-centered service experience, I keep test and debug our website, testing it on multiple devices (mobile phone, tablets, desktop, TVs) and browsers (IE, Chrome, Safari, Firefox) to ensure our website is accessible for all users. I made multiple adjustment until our website gave users the best possible experience.</p>


<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>Involve users early and often. We need to learn from users, and keep testing the website on multiple devices and browsers and iterate it.</p>
